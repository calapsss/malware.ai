# Simply Ransom

This code encrypts all files in the specified directory using the cryptography package. It generates a random salt and uses it to derive an encryption key using the PBKDF2 algorithm. The key is then used to create a Fernet object, which is used to encrypt the data in the files. The encrypted data is then saved back to the original file, overwriting the original data.

The code then sends the encryption key to the specified email address using the smtplib package. Finally, it deletes the key file to prevent the key from being accessed by unauthorized users.

To improve this code, you may want to add error handling to handle cases where the email server cannot be reached, or the login credentials are invalid. You may also want to add additional checks to ensure that the specified directory exists and that the files in the directory can be accessed and encrypted. Additionally, you may want to add a command-line interface to allow the user to specify the directory, password, and email address as arguments when running the script.
