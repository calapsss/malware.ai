Only for pentesting and research purposes. 

## Notes
If the target user does not have Python installed on their system, your script will not be able to run. In order to make your script work on every default Windows computer, you will need to include a Python interpreter with your script, or create a standalone executable file that contains your script and the required dependencies.

To include a Python interpreter with your script, you can use a tool like pyinstaller to package your script and the required dependencies into a standalone executable file. This will allow you to distribute your script as a single file that can be run on any system without requiring Python to be installed.

Here is an example of how you can use pyinstaller to create a standalone executable file from your script:

1. Install the pyinstaller package by running the following command:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
2. Run the following command to create a standalone executable file from your script:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile my_script.py
```

This command will create a standalone executable file in the dist directory of your project. You can distribute this executable file to users, and it can be run on any system without requiring Python to be installed.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like cx_freeze to create a standalone executable file from your script. cx_freeze is similar to pyinstaller, but it has additional features that may be useful for creating standalone executables.


1. Install the cx_freeze package by running the following command:
```bash
pip install cx_freeze
```
2. Create a setup.py file in the root directory of your project and add the following code to the file:
```python
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

# Define the required packages
build_exe_options = {"packages": ["cryptography", "email"]}

# Create the standalone executable
setup(
    name = "my_script",
    version = "0.1",
    options = {"build_exe": build_exe_options},
    executables = [Executable("my_script.py")]
)
```

This code defines the packages that are required by your script, and creates a standalone executable file from your script.

Run the following command to create the standalone executable file:

```bash
python setup.py build
```

This command will create a standalone executable file in the build directory of your project. You can distribute this executable file to users, and it can be run on any system without requiring Python to be installed.

Using a tool like pyinstaller or cx_freeze to create a standalone executable file from your script allows you to distribute your script as a single file that can be run on any system without requiring Python to be installed. This can be useful if you want to distribute your script to users who may not have Python installed on their system.
